# kubernetes-observability-lab

## Overview

The `kubernetes-observability-lab` repository provides a curated set of resources, configurations, and examples designed to demonstrate best practices in observability within Kubernetes environments. This lab is intended for DevOps engineers, Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), and platform teams seeking to implement robust monitoring, logging, and tracing solutions aligned with production-grade standards.

## Objectives

- Deploy a fully observable Kubernetes cluster using open-source and cloud-native tools.
- Showcase integration patterns for metrics, logs, and traces.
- Provide hands-on examples for alerting, dashboards, and service-level indicators (SLIs).
- Enable experimentation with observability stacks in a controlled lab environment.

## Scope

This lab includes:

- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates for cluster provisioning (e.g., using KinD, Minikube, or cloud providers).
- Helm charts and manifests for deploying observability tools such as:
  - **Prometheus** (metrics collection)
  - **Grafana** (visualization)
  - **Loki** (log aggregation)
  - **Tempo** or **Jaeger** (distributed tracing)
  - **OpenTelemetry** (instrumentation)
- Sample workloads with instrumentation for observability testing.
- Configuration examples for alerting rules and dashboards.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Kubernetes and container orchestration.
- Familiarity with observability concepts (metrics, logs, traces).
- Local development environment with:
  - Docker
  - kubectl
  - Helm
  - Optional: Terraform (for cloud-based deployments)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andreastoppa/kubernetes-observability-lab.git
   cd kubernetes-observability-lab
   ```

2. Follow the setup instructions in the `docs/setup.md` file to provision the lab environment.

3. Deploy observability stack using provided Helm charts or manifests.

4. Access Grafana dashboards and explore metrics, logs, and traces.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add support for multi-cluster observability
- [ ] Integrate with cloud-native managed services (e.g., Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch)
- [ ] Include SLO/SLI templates and examples
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline integration for observability validation
